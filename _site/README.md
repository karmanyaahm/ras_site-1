# UT IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Website

This is the website for the UT Austin IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. You can view the site at [ras.ece.utexas.edu](ras.ece.utexas.edu).

This site was built using the ReactJS framework using the Vite frontend tool for development.

## Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the `npm` package manager installed on your machine. It can usually be installed by your operating system's package manager.

## Installation:
Run the following commands in your terminal:
`
git clone git@github.com:DhruvNistala/ras_site.git
cd ras_site
npm install
`
This will load the repository and install all of the required Node packages.

## Running a local server:
Run `npm run dev` in your terminal to activate the live server and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser to view the site.

## Deploying your changes:
Run `./deploy.sh` in your terminal. When prompted, enter your UT EID.
Alternatively, run `echo [your_ut_eid] | ./deploy.sh` if you don't want to wait for the prompt.
