# Robomasters Spring Kick-Off!
## 2022 - Robomasters

Hey guys! This semester, we need to hit the ground running to be able to compete in the summer. <!--more--> Last semester, we focused on preparing ourselves for the season by purchasing all the necessary materials, prototyping in CAD, and learning about the programming environment. This semester, we need to complete building and programming our final robot, which is going to be quite the challenge. 

There’s a lot to do for both the hardware and software teams. The mechanical team has been working on manufacturing all the custom parts while we wait for parts to come in. Once everything has arrived, we will begin assembling the robot. The electrical/software teams are still learning the ins and outs of the STM32 microcontroller and the RoboMaster ecosystem. We also looking into implementing computer vision algorithms this semester. 

​Hopefully, by the end of the school year, we will be fully prepared to compete at A&M this summer!
