# CURM - CURM Update!
## 2019 - CURM

CURM is just over a month away!

I hope that everyone’s projects are coming along well. CURM had its first social a couple weeks ago at Cold Cookie Co. We spent some time and discussed project ideas. Thank you to everyone who came out! We will be having another social after spring break that will be a combination of fun activities and talking about robots.

If anyone has questions about CURM, don’t hesitate to contact me through slack.

I hope to see you soon!
