# Dancebot - Dancebot Software Updates
## 2020 - Demobot

Matthew again. One of our firmware members recently completed a driver for the
LED eyes that will be installed on the new Baby Dancebots.

This is a pretty cool driver since it'll provide the prototype functionality for us to
extend code for all sorts of Adafruit NeoPixel lighting drivers that are part of
our other Demobots, like the Mothership eyes and the Tower of Power disco ball,
windows, and clock face.

I'll be talking more about this driver today, and explaining a little bit about
how we're designing for extensibility and plug and play for our robots.


#### The Base

First, we have a base wrapper class that provides the basic skeleton we want all
of our relevant NeoPixel drivers to use.

```c++
#pragma once
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

/**
 * A wrapper around the Adafruit Neopixel class with a bare bones set of
 * functionality.
 */
class NeoPixelBase {
    public:
        /**
         * The base constructor for a generic NeoPixelBase object.
         *
         * @param[in] pin The pin of the uC that any control signals should be
         *            sent from.
         * @param[in] numPixels The number of LEDs that will be commanded by
         *            this object.
         */
        explicit NeoPixelBase(const int pin, const int numPixels);

        /**
         * Sets the brightness of all the pixels in the object at once.
         *
         * @param[in] brightness The brightness of each NeoPixel in the object.
         */
        void setBrightness(const int brightness);

        /**
         * Turns on the object and puts it into a DEFAULT state.
         * It can be overridden by derived classes to define what exactly
         * DEFAULT does.
         */
        void startup();

        /**
         * Shuts down the object and resets any internal variables not tied to
         * the constructor.
         * It can be overridden by derived classes to define what exactly
         * should be shut off.
         */
        void shutdown();

        /**
         * Sets a new state, or command for the object to perform. The commands
         * are strictly limited to those predefined by the developer.
         *
         * @param[in] state The state the NeoPixelBase should be in.
         */
        void updateState(const State state);

        /**
         * Returns the state enum of the current operating state.
         *
         * @return State The current state of the NeoPixelBase.
         */
        State getState();

    public:
        /**
         * Our default state enum. This is used for sending discrete commands to
         * the class to update the internal state.
         *
         * Derived classes will override this enum.
         */
        static enum State{
            DEFAULT
        };

    private:
        /** We utilise the Adafruit Neopixel object to execute HAL functions. */
        Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels;

        /** By default, we set our base state to DEFAULT. */
        State state = State::DEFAULT;

        /**
         * The brightness of our pixels. setBrightness converts its int
         * parameter into a float.
         */
        float brightness;
}
```

This wrapper class gives us a bit of insight into the operation of the drivers
we are developing for the Dancebots and potentially other Demobots. In particular,
we are using a state scheme, where the backend operation of the class is
dependent on its current state.

There's less customizability to this method (i.e. the user can't specify
specifics to turn on whenever they want), but it allows developers greater
control over what can and will happen, which simplifies debugging and prevents
unwanted behavior.

For our application, where we want the Dancebot to use a set of discrete
expressions, this is perfect.


### Finally...

I didn't show any implementation code here since it would probably take two more
blog posts to cover if I get around to it. Perhaps I'll do that in the next post,
and have a gif to show y'all to boot!

Thanks for sticking around and reading this.
