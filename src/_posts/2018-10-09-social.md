# Social - Ultimate
## 2018 - Social

This semester, RAS is playing intramural ultimate.

Our first game was last week, but our opponents did not show up! It seems that our skill intimidated them.

We just practiced the basics of ultimate and eventually found another team to scrimmage. Hopefully we will find worthy opponents in the next 2 weeks. Playoffs, here we come!
