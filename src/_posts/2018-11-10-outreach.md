# Lego Outreach
## 2018 - Outreach

In the month of October, IEEE RAS Outreach coordinated an event with representatives from ARM and FIRST to help with FLL Build Day.

Volunteers for this event help construct the Lego fields for the FLL competitions.  Members of IEEE RAS spent the day building field pieces for FLL to ensure the fields would be ready for the upcoming competitions.
