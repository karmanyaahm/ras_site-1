# Dancebot - Dancebot Update
## 2020 - Demobot

Surprise update! I've been working on the Dancebot over the last week (and severely procrastinating on my final labs), and I wanted to share what's been done.

Firstly, I've revised the entire network and software architecture of the robot. The changes I will be suggesting will primarily allow us to have multiple robots on the same network and server.


### Software Architecture

This image describes the current file structure for the Dancebot. The sketch setup() function does two things. It sets up a web controller (going through the process I explained in my last point), and then initializes the robot. The web server runs asynchronously, so we won't need to touch it after it spins up. What happens next in the loop() method is that the Demobot checks its current state and runs for a bit, then sends a request to the server to update itself. This occurs in DemobotAPI.

Since the two files are independent, we can replace the internals of DemobotAPI (say, the implementation of calls to Dancing Servos with, say, Polargraph) with minimal modifications to the overall structure.

It's not completely decoupled, however. If I wanted to use this template for Polargraph, I would need to update the API and data structure used in WebController and RobotConfig, as well as the implementations in DemobotAPI regarding updateState() (a POST request to the server) and its internal data structure.

This is where I've gotten so far. I've gotten the API calls to work and correct HTML/JS to serve on the user end. I'm also able to set up the WebController in all three modes (AP/STA/CON). What's next is to implement the updateState() request and see if I can drive the Dancebot. This will be the foundation of our Dancebot Swarm project.

If you're interested on learning more about this project, you can join our slack at utras.slack.com and message me (@RoboticFish) or email me at matthewjkyu@gmail.com.
