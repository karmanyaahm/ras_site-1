# Fall 2022 Robotathon Launch!
## 2022 March - Robomasters

Hi everyone!

I hope you are all having a great start to the semester. I wanted to update you all on our Robotathon 2022 competition. We had our kickoff on Monday, September 12th and it was a huge success with about 80 students signing up this year!

Here is a picture of all the Raslets who came to Kickoff:

Now that we have had our Kickoff, I can finally reveal our theme: juRASsic! This year we are combining robotics and dinos. We have 3 main challenges for the students where they will use 3 sensors (IR sensor, line follower, and color sensor). As of now the students should be finishing up their second checkpoint where they need to meet with their team to brainstorm a design for their robot. We specifically want them to focus on sensor placement, keeping in mind the 3 challenges and what will help them most efficiently complete the tasks. We are also having them consider the placement of their TM4C, battery, and breadboard, in order to have easy access but also a good center of gravity. Lastly, they need to have an idea for how they will approach the mechanical challenge, whether by having a passive or active method. A lot of teams have also thought about the aesthetics, trying to implement some dino aspects. 

Other checkpoints include building their physical base and starting to code their sensors. The students will gain a lot of hands on experience with all the resources in TIW. Take a look at our rulebook if you would like to learn more. 

I will have another update soon on the progress of the teams and the results of our final competition which is set to take place on Saturday, November 12th. Stay tuned to see which team wins our Robotathon 2022 competition :)
