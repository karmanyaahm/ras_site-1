# The Region V Season has Begun!
## 2018 - Region V

The Region V season has begun!

We are very excited to have received our 2019 IEEE Region V competition
rules ([http://r5conferences.org/competitions/robotics-competition/](http://r5conferences.org/competitions/robotics-competition/)) which
we introduced at our first Region V meeting on Thursday, September 20th!
The Mars-themed competition this year looks especially interesting,
requiring us to navigate randomly placed obstacles, and deposit cubes
labeled with letters in their correct slots.

We have begun our brainstorming process and plan on beginning field
construction this week as to allow us to move into the testing and
development phases as soon as possible:

We are greatly looking forward to have a productive semester semester all
of our team members, new and old, and learning along the way!
