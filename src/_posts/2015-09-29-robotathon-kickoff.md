# Robotathon kick-off!
## 2015 - Robotathon

Robotathon is officially in session! This year's competition is called RASBall!

[Check out this link for the full rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hfSpVskHWOAh7aOXTNXNO6KRsrEJpE1zWfta7-i_PLo).
RASBall is essentially soccer, with many balls and several robots. We have 17
teams competing, for a total of 102 RASlets and several more on the waitlist.
We're aiming for zero deaths by robot this season.
