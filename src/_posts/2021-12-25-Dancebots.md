# Dancebots Fall 2021 Wrap-Up
## 2021 - Dancebots Wrap Up

Hello all! 

Just wanted to put out a quick blog post about progress regarding Dancebots for the semester! Progress has been a bit slow as in person activities resume around campus, but we are excited to resume work on this committee for next semester! <!--more-->

Most of our work has been on the hardware side, such as checking battery chemistry and parts inventory inside the RAS office. While this doesnâ€™t result in much robot construction, it is necessary given the gap year that has resulted of COVID-19. 

Next semester, we hope to do a prototype of our gantry system using several stepper motors. If all proceeds well, we will explore more options regarding using an electromagnet to pick up a new version of Dancebot. 

If you are interested in working on and designing new robots, come check us out!
