What a great kickoff to the semester! IGVC has been in the planning stage for the past couple of weeks. This has involved organizing the division of work for the different subteams. <!--more--> A lot of interest has been expressed in joining the mechanical and programming subteams, so we’re looking for more people interested in the electrical aspect of the robot. Regardless of what you’re interested in though, we’d love to have you! No prior experience is needed.

An important development in the planning stage this past week for the team is the possibility of working in person in the Makerspace. This week we will be meeting with Roger Rose, the facilities/operations manager, so if you’re interested in coming to work in person, you must attend this virtual meeting! Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions at pjmathews731@utexas.edu.
