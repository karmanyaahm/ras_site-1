## 2020 - Demobot

It's been a while since the last blog post from the Dancebot team. We've received a lot of interest from the new RAS members in joining this subcommittee, and have moved ahead in setting up projects for the members to work on.

I'll list a quick summary table of the projects that we'll be doing this semester below:

Additionally, during our first meeting the software and firmware team finalized the communication protocol API (Application Programming Interface) for the server.

The mechanical team also discussed a lot of good ideas on Dancebot V2.0 body design and Mothership 1.0 body design.

**Why are we sending data with a GET request?**

Indeed, if you're thinking that there's a disparity here, you're right. We should be using a POST request to manage the sending of data. We're using GET requests right now because they are just a little bit easier to implement a first version prototype.

### What does a GET request look like?

For the Dancebot, a GET request will look like the following:
`myserver.com/endpoint?name1=value1&name2=value2`

Let's break this down.

- `myserver.com/` is the root address of the URL page we're accessing. If we just entered `myserver.com/`, we would typically be served the HTML page like the one you're reading right now.

- `/endpoint` is a unique endpoint that we specify. We are looking for requests at this endpoint from the Dancebots to guess what: join the server! We append important robot information to this endpoint to identify the robot that wants to join.

- `?` tells us a GET request is starting.

- `name1=value1` assigns the string value `value1` to the argument `name1`. Our server, upon receiving the GET request, will parse and interpret the variable for us to use in further processing.

- `&` is essentially a delimiter that splits two arguments. As you can see argument `name2` comes right after and is assigned `value2`.

This request is processed by the server and returns either a success or a failure (in the event that the request is malformed).


### Bonus: Security

There's one thing I haven't talked about in this post: security!
A discerning reader would probably notice that since we gave away what the API looks like, you can fake requests to our server. That means you can do a bunch of nefarious things to our server and robots while it's on, like:

- make it appear that we have a hundred robots on the server

- lock the robot state by spamming commands to it so it appears broken to the end user

- DDOS our server by sending so many requests that our server kills itself

These potential events are catastrophic for an actual application with economic and social implications. This enforces the idea that when we (or yall) develop software, we need to keep in mind ways people can abuse it and develop best practices to prevent said abuse.

Something our team is looking at as a next step after this prototype is set up is to send encryption keys with requests. That way only authenticated users will be able to send valid commands. For example, each Dancebot can have its own private key that the server already knows. If a malicious user attempts to spoof itself as a Dancebot with the same ID and send bad data to the user, it'll be unable to do so because it doesn't have the private key.
