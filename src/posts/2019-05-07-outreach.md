RAS had a great time at the final two outreach events for the 2018-19 school year. We were asked to show our robots, office space and the makerspace to Girl Scouts who were taking robotics courses at UT.

In May, we went to the Austin Maker Faire, and made connections with other UT groups such as an engineering group in the UT art school. We also got to demo the polargraph and dancebot.  
This year has been highly successful and RAS would like to thank everyone who helped volunteer for outreach this year.

Our next outreach coordinator, Burak, will be taking up next semester's role.
