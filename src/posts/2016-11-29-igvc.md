IGVC has begun meeting during the Fall 2016 semester.

As a summary, IGVC is a
robotics competition where various universities across the United States compete.
The goal of the competition is to create a robot that can move autonomously
across an open field while avoiding obstacles and staying within path boundaries.
The robot accomplishes these tasks through the use of GPS navigation, visual
processing, and movement control. UT RAS has been working on this year's IGVC
entry for a few years. We have a small yet dedicated team working on the various
modules required for competition. Right now we are developing and testing the
visual processing systems to differentiate between path boundaries and the path
itself. In addition to the components necessary for competition, we are modifying
the manual control scheme for driving the robot so that it is more user-friendly
and can be driven at various events. We will continue our work and will be
competing in this year's competition in Rochester, Michigan. If you are a UT
student interested in joining the committee, we welcome all newcomers and will
help them learn the skills required. We hope to begin testing the entire robot
by February of 2017.
