IEEE RAS got to show off and explain a few of our cool robots at the 2019 UT Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day.  We brought out the cargo robot, RC car, polargraph and dancebot.  We got to explain how each one of them worked to the kids and even let them drive and control them.  Our next event is Explore UT which is the first weekend of March this year.  Explore UT is a massive community event put on at UT that will have around 50,000 students this year, and RAS is excited to teach and demonstrate robotics to as many students as we can!
