The Fall semester has well under way so that means so is Region V!

We are excited to be going to Oklahoma this Spring to take part in the [recycling themed Region V Robotics Competition](https://r5conferences.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/126/Robotics_Game_Manual.pdf). Our team consists of roughly 15 people and is split into three subcommittees mechanical, electrical, and software. We have started the designing phase and have completed some conceptual CAD.
