RAS is currently in the final weeks of many competitions, but we still find time outside of school and robotics to get together.

Two Fridays ago, RAS went on its second annual trip to Austin Bouldering Project, an enormous indoor rock climbing center. Some of our members are experienced climbers, but for many it was their first time. We also got the coolest social picture of all time, mixtape coming out next fall.

Additionally, RAS had its first IM game last Sunday. We chose to play sand volleyball this year, and it is a blast. Although we lost, our first round was very close and everybody had fun. Hereâ€™s to a win next week!

Be on the lookout for a *post-competition social, probably a video/ board game night before finals*.
