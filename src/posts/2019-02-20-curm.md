CURM, or the Convention for Unconventional Robotics Movement, is an annual robotics showcase that focuses on robots that move unconventionally. This event is designed to challenge participants to get outside of their comfort zone and create that crazy robot that youâ€™ve always wanted to make. In past years we have had robots that walk, hop, slither, vibrate, and generally move in all sorts of crazy or unexpected way. This is the coolest event of the semester!

If you are interested in robotics research, we will be inviting some research groups on campus to show off their robots. This is an opportunity to network with professors and graduate students.

The date for the convention has been officially set to April 27th! Come show off your awesome creations, eat some food, and see some cool research projects.
