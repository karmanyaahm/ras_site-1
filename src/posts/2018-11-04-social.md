Unfortunately our last three IM ultimate games have been cancelled due to inclement weather.

Our second game should take place this Thursday!

Additionally, we will be playing sand volleyball this Friday, 11/02, at Pease Park. Joining us is another engineering org called e-Nable, who 3D print cost-effective, mechanically actuated prosthetic arms. Below is an arm designed by their parent organization which I had the opportunity to build about 1 year ago. Iâ€™m a big fan of their work, and RAS is looking forward to beating them in volleyball this coming Friday!

Coming up, I am planning a bouldering social with the IEEE Power & Energy Society (PES). More details to follow.
