On Saturday October 7th, our organization took part in Lego Day for the First Lego League.

Lego day is an event where members of the UT RAS build lego obstacles and fields for the First Lego League, in which teams of middle school students use Lego Mindstorms robotics to complete a set of tasks. 15 of our members, including 4 robotathon participants, drove out to the ARM office and helped to build 70 obstacles and 7 fields for the upcoming competition. We worked alongside several high school robotics clubs and a handful of full time employees including one of our alumni, Cruz Montreal. UT RAS is excited to work with our local community to help introduce robotics to the next generation, and we hope to work on future projects with the First Lego League.
