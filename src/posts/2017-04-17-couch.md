## 2017 - Couch

After at least two years, the couch of UT IEEE RAS rolls again!

The society dearly loves its furniture. In late November of 2012, RAS
mounted a motorized wheel system to the communal couch. The couch was
subsequently fitted with RGB LED lighting and a speaker system for the 2013
Red Bull Creation Contest. Relevant videos may be found
[here](https://youtu.be/L9J6vn5uEHM) and [there](https://youtu.be/2wl4B_LGgxU).
And this was not even the first iteration: a similar couch, since lost to the
ravages of time, was built in early 2010, as documented by
[this](https://youtu.be/3hJy3dN2v8s)!

The couch had not survived the interim until now well. It has not, to my
knowledge, moved once in the past half decade under its own power---until
now. For the past few months, a dedicated team of RAS furniture ninjas has
unceasingly (technical term for 'about one hour per week') restored the
couch to functional condition. This included unjamming a gearbox, rewiring
the system (sorry, RAS alumni, but that hack you put together was not
pretty), and writing some test code (found at
[GitHub](https://github.com/ut-ras/couch-firmware)).

As a result of our tireless efforts, the couch now moves. We offer proof at
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/kaYiUHjtGvY). However, progress still needs to be
made.  The drive system has seen its best days, the couch upholstery is well
past its prime, and, most shockingly, the couch boasts neither speakers nor
lights! Thus, we hope to, after moving to our new home in the new UT Austin
EERC building next year, redesign and rebuild the couch, properly, this
time, to again make its fabled trip down Speedway street.
