A new semester is off to a great start! While we were not able to engage to the extent we would have liked over the past two virtual semesters, the groundwork we laid has been able to set us off at a good pace this fall. The Demobots we have been working on this semester include Talons of Acquisition (TOA), Couchbot, and Dancebot.<!--more-->

 I'll begin with our newest addition: TOA, our claw machine demobot. So far, the mechanical team has focused on getting all the CAD models up to speed with their in-person prototype and creating files to laser cut for the z-axis winch (aka the part that will lift and lower the claw). The electrical team has focused on getting in new parts, such as buttons, joysticks, and batteries to be able to complete the initial prototype of the user interface board. While this board is being completed, they are also working ok code so these buttons and joysticks can work with the Arduino to control the stepper and servo motors needed to move the claw in the x and y-axis.

The other Demobot which has exciting updates in the Couchbot. After an unfortunate start to the semester when we found the Couchbot's batteries dead, the Couchbot team has bounced back! The Couchbot team has successfully been able to take the couch to the floor of the EER, start, and drive it around on multiple occasions. They are currently planning the next steps in the Couchbotâ€™s journey, will this include colorful lights? Waterproofing? Speakers? Only time can tell what fun things are in store.

 If you would like to learn more about Demobots and get your hands on our cool projects this fall please stop by our meetings on Tuesday at 6pm in EER 1.504 or shoot any questions you have to the RAS Discord or me (Caitlin) at [cmonty@utexas.edu](mailto:cmonty@utexas.edu).
