Hello everyone! Welcome to the Corporate Committeeâ€™s first Blog post :3 <!--more-->


### Corporate Committee


**What do we do**

Professional Development - Communicate and build partnerships with company representatives to plan events such as Tech Talks, interactive workshops, and social events. 

At the moment, we offer company representatives in-person and hybrid events. 


**Corporate Committee meetings are now happening on Fridays from 5-6 PM at the RAS office (EER 0.822)!** 

Since the committee is still growing, feel free to submit your meeting availability [here](http://whenisgood.net/Corporate2022) to see if there needs to be changes in our meeting time/day. 


**Who can join?**

Any RAS member can join, any year and major. No experience is needed :) I encourage you to join!
