IEEE RAS Outreach had a busy first half of the semester.

We put out booths at Gone to Engineering and Party on the Plaza getting over 150 new people signed up for RAS!

In addition, we participated in the first ever Cockrell Day of Service and had a member volunteer for the UT Sustainability Squad. The second half of the semester will be busy as RAS is scheduled to have outreach events with FIRST and Girl Scouts!
